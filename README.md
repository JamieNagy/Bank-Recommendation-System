# Product Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project builds a product recommendation system for a bank. The system analyzes customer data and uses machine learning techniques to recommend banking products based on customer profiles.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing value imputation, feature engineering, and feature scaling to prepare the data for model training.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilized Gradient Boosting Classifier and Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of customers selecting specific banking products.
- **Recommendation Engine**: The system recommends the top N banking products based on customer preferences and interaction history.
- **Association Rules**: Generated association rules using the Apriori algorithm to identify patterns in product selections.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Feature Name Transformation**: Renamed columns for better understanding.
2. **Missing Value Imputation**: Handled missing values using a combination of most common value imputation and mean imputation.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Grouped age and income into bins to create additional features for model training.

## Machine Learning Process
1. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Trained on the transformed data to predict the likelihood of customers selecting banking products.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Used to further refine the predictions generated by the Gradient Boosting Classifier.
3. **GBDT Features**: Features generated by the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree were used as input to the Logistic Regression model.

## Product Recommendation
A custom function `gbdt_product_recommender` recommends the top N banking products based on the predicted probability scores for each customer.
